This section describes the core concepts behind Pulumi:

* [Programming Model](programming-model.html): the most important concepts you'll use in Pulumi programs.
* [Projects](project.html): Pulumi's way of organizing your infrastructure as code.
* [Stacks](stack.html): Pulumi's fundamental unit of partitioning, configuring, and scaling environments.
* [Configuration and Secrets](config.html): how to configure stacks, including storing secret encrypted settings.
* [Organizing Stacks and Projects](organizing-stacks-projects.html): best practices for organizing your Pulumi programs.
* [How Pulumi Works](how.html): a peek under the hood to learn more about how Pulumi performs deployments.
* [State and Backends](state.html): an overview of how Pulumi stores state and manages concurrency.

After learning these core concepts, you'll want to learn [more about the CLI](commands.html).
